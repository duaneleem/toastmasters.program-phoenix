To attain the prestigious status of a Distinguished Club, one effective strategy we've implemented is the consistent use of email newsletters.

In this guide, we will delve into the various platforms suitable for clubs, sharing insights and recommendations based on our experiences at Swift Plaza Toastmasters.



## Platforms for Newsletters

There are several platforms that can be used for Newsletters:

- [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/)
- [Constant Contact](https://www.constantcontact.com/)

In this guide, we will discuss how we have successfully utilized MailChimp to send weekly updates to our members and guests, enhancing our communication and engagement.


## How we used MailChimp

What we have found effective is to send Newsletters to members and also guests.  The cadence set initially was every week.  We found that sending Newsletters every 2 weeks is easier for the VP Public Relations Officer and isn't too overwhelming for others.

The sections in our Newsletters:

- Overview of the last meeting(s).
- DCP Status
- Invite audience to visit our club meetings.
