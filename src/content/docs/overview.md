description: A guide on establishing a club towards Distinguished.
---

I began my journey as a Toastmasters District 57 Club Coach in February 2023. Like other club coaches, my primary objective is to guide the club I'm assigned to achieve Distinguished status.

To accomplish this, I have employed a variety of tools to enhance our club's performance. In the near future, I plan to share detailed guides on the diverse tools and strategies I've implemented during my tenure as Club Coach for Swift Plaza Toastmasters.

I've written my tools & techniques in the following sections:

- Gap Analysis
- Club Processes
- Establish Club Website
- Newsletter
- Guests Follow-ups
- Membership Management
